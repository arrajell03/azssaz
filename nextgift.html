    <p><b>On this special day, I want to celebrate not just your birthday but also the beautiful person you are. Your strength, hard work, mindset, your high level of patience, selflessness, very compassionate person, your beliefs, resiliency, determination, understanding, love for your family, being independent and many to mention that I cant enumerate it all, but it truly inspires me to become a better person and I admire you for that. You've always been there for me, offering a shoulder to cry on and a hand to hold when things get tough. Thank you a lot, lalang.</b></p>
<br>
    <p><b>I just pray to God that may you walk with His presence, seek and honor Him. May He bless you with wisdom, courage, strength and guidance all throughout your life. May you never forget our good Lord whenever you achieve something but rather thank Him, which comes solely from Him. May you do everything in your life for His Glory. May you alwyas remember this scripture that I would leave here, it's according to Psalm 20:4 ESV, that says "May He grant you your heart’s desire and fulfill all your plans!". May his goodness live on in your life and be a blessing to others.</b></p>
<br>
    <p><b>Remember that I am always here for you, I will always support and pray for you. I am rooting for you and I am very proud of who you are becoming everyday. I know you can do everything by God's Grace; just put your trust in Him and to yourself. I am sincerely thankful and grateful to God for your new life today. I miss you po so much, I love you today and always lalang(⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡</b></p>
