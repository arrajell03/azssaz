    <p><b>My dearest Aljim Zor,</b></p>
    <p><b>Today is a special day because the world has been blessed by your presence. As we celebrate your birthday, I'd like to take a moment to express how much I love you and how much you've influenced my life. Life has a way of surprising us with unexpected gifts, and you are one of the most precious and beautiful gift I've ever received. It's incredible how someone I never expected to have such an impact on my life.</b></p>

     <p><b>Our connection was formed through mutual support, understanding, and patience in both good and bad times. You have now become an important part of my life. Your compassion and kindness have touched my heart, and I find comfort in your presence, knowing that I am loved and appreciated exactly as I am.</b></p>

      <p><b>Our shared experiences have created memories that I will cherish forever, and I am grateful for every single one of them. Whether it's sharing deep conversations, walks with tofu at ayala road, going on spontaneous laag,laughing and teasing each other, simply enjoying quiet moments of silence, and watching movies/series together, each experience with you is a testament to the amazing connection we share.</b></p>
